/**
 * The MachineViewGenerator is a sort of "cache" that only allows you to create
 * one instance of a view for a machine's model (assuming that all views are
 * created through the same MVG). This is necessary because the update all
 * machines operation, that is executed whenever a machine joins or leaves,
 * throws out all machines and recreates those that are in the list (this
 * handles adds and removes, in order). However, since those views register
 * observers in their machines' models, they would never be garbage collected.
 * This way, when the update all machines operation throws away a view and then
 * attempts to recreate it, the MVG simply calls update on the existing view,
 * and then returns it.
