 * This class encapsulates the behavior our primitive IGlobalVars deserializer.
 * Global variables are stored in a new-line delineated format, in the following
 * order: root ballot path, ballot file, ballot file schema, layout file, layout
 * file schema. "Root path" means the path to the directory which contanis all
 * ballot xml files and a directory named "media" where all media files are
 * located. Both schemas and the ballot file should be in a fully qualified
 * path+filename format. For the layout file entry, include a fully qualified
 * path+prefix, where prefix follows the layout xml convention: prefix_<size>_<language>.
