/**
 * A data logger is a simple wrapper around an s-expression output writer. It
 * offers a few added benefits:<br>
 * 1) Every expression that gets written to disk needs to be in the form (UID
 * Type Event Timestamp) and this class will guarantee that only entries of this
 * type are written down in the log.<br>
 * 2) In order to accomplish #1, this class offers a nice interface (a method
 * definition) which eliminates the need for an outside user to even ever
 * construct an ASExpression.<br>
 * <br>
 * This module is to be used with human factors testing only. This is not to be
 * confused with the module that does redundant event logging over a network.
