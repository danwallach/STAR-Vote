/**
 * This class represents a single link in the group of outgoing links from a
 * given host. Each link has a listen thread associated with it. It's job is to
 * simply listen for incoming traffic on said link, and relay said traffic to
 * the host. The host will then, of course, decide what to do with it. Because
 * each link is a keeper of this listening thread, you must call start() and
 * stop() on it before it will behave in the expected way. The link's thread
 * will operateIndependent at a priority one less than the calling thread. This is to aid
 * auditorium in being able to keep up with many links flooding messages onto
 * its queues.
