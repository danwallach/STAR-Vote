Because the verifier will need to provide a way for the rule writer to express wildcards in his expressions, we have to make a few extensions to the s-expression human readable format. 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Any Expression:</strong> #any
</li><li><strong>Any String:</strong> #string
</li><li><strong>Any List:</strong> #list
</li><li><strong>Any list that conforms to a pattern:</strong> #listof:&lt;pattern&gt;
</li></ul><p>
Which means we add ':' to the lexer grammar, and the parser must construct special expressions for each of the four cases.
