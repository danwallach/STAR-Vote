<h3 id="MenubarandToolbar">Menubar and Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The menubar and toolbar were added to the program to provide some familiar controls to the user.  The most important/used functions become buttons on the toolbar, while they are also echoed along with less important or used functions within the menubar.  Currently the toolbar consists of the <a class="wiki" href="New/Open/Save.html" rel="follow">New/Open/Save</a> functions, as well as an Export button.  Later, a Languages and/or Parties button may be added.  As other functions are added, they will be introduced as menu items to keep the UI clean and concise.  The menubar also has an Edit menu containing Cut, Copy, and Paste, and possibly Undo and Redo down the road.
</p>
<h3 id="CardListPanel">Card List Panel</h3>
<p>
The card list panel contains a list (in order) of all cards on the ballot.  The user can easily add another card via the [+] button below the list, which pops up a menu containing the different types of cards the user can add.  After the user chooses one from the popup menu, it is added at the end of the ballot and shows in the card editor panel.  There are also controls for deleting a card, and moving one up or down, which operate on the currently selected card.  Further than the move buttons, drag and drop is supported for moving cards around within the card list.
</p>
<h3 id="CardEditorPanel">Card Editor Panel</h3>
<p>
To begin working on a card, the user simply needs to select it in the card list panel, and it will be highlighted in the card list panel and show up in the card editor panel (also, if the user adds a card it will automatically be brought up for editing).  The controls that are shown in the card editor panel differ based on what type of card the user created, but they all contain a Title text field (which updates the name listed in the card list panel), and a drop down to select the language the user wishes to edit (<em>multiple languages are not yet supported</em>).  The controls that are unique to each type of card are listed below.
</p>
<h4 id="RaceCard">Race Card</h4>
<p>
The card editor panel for a race card contains a table to enter the candidates' names.  Similar to the card list, the table has its own set of add/delete/move up/move down buttons, which perform the functions analagous to their names.  In addition, the table also supports drag and drop.  The table only has one column, for the candidates' names, but in the future it may have columns for party and other information.
</p>
<h4 id="PresidentialRaceCard">Presidential Race Card</h4>
<p>
Similar to the Race Card's editor panel, but the table has two columns: one for the candidate's name and one for the running mate's name.
</p>
<h4 id="PropositionCard">Proposition Card</h4>
<p>
The proposition card editor panel does not have a table, as the <a class="wiki" href="Yes/No.html" rel="follow">Yes/No</a> options are automatically entered.  There is, however, a large text box for the user to enter the description of the proposition.
</p>
<h3 id="PreviewPanel">Preview Panel</h3>
<p>
The preview panel (<em>not yet implemented</em>) shows a live preview of what the current card's content will look when exported to <a class="wiki" href="VoteBox.html" rel="follow">VoteBox</a>.  This panel may require a scrollbar somewhere if there are a lot of candidates.
</p>
<h3 id="Dialogs">Dialogs</h3>
<p>
Open, Save, and Export, all use a !JFileChooser to choose the location for the files.  Also, during the export operation, a progress dialog is popped up while the task is running in the background.
</p>
<h3 id="DragandDrop">Drag and Drop</h3>
<p>
The card list and the table of candidates both support drag and drop operations, using Java's API.
