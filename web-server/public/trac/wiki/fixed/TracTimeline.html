<p>
The timeline provides a historic view of the project in a single report.
</p>
<p>
It lists all Trac events that have occurred in chronological order, a
brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for
the change.
</p>
<p>
The timeline lists these kinds of events:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wiki page events</strong>  Creation and changes
</li><li><strong>Ticket events</strong>  Creation and resolution/closing (and optionally other changes)
</li><li><strong>Source code changes </strong>  Repository check-ins
</li><li><strong>Milestone </strong>  Milestone completed
</li></ul><p>
Each event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, who authored the change as well as
a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to filter the displayed events with the various filters in the option panel:
</p>
<ul><li><em>View changes from</em>  the date from which to start displaying events (current date if empty). Events that occurred after this date will not be shown, only those that occurred before that date.
</li><li><em>and X days back</em>  how many days backwards in time to get events.
</li><li><em>done by</em>  the author of an event. It accepts a space-separated list of authors for which events should be included. Alternatively, if the author names are prefixed by a "-" character, then the events having those authors will be excluded, and all the others included. Single or double quotes can be used for specifying author names containing space characters. <em>(since 0.12)</em>
</li><li><em>Changesets in all repositories</em>  if you have more than one repository connected to your Trac project, then you can filter the output so events from specific repositories are not shown. <em>(since 0.12)</em>
</li><li><em>Milestones reached</em>  display or hide milestones reached.
</li><li><em>Opened and closed tickets</em>  display or hide ticket open or close events.
</li><li><em>Wiki changes</em>  display or hide Wiki change events.
</li></ul><p>
