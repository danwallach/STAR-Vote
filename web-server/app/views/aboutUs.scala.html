<p>
    STAR-Vote is an academic exploration into various new developments in voting security research.
    Heavily emphasising paper trails and end to end cryptography the project hopes to provide a more secure
    Direct-Recording Electronic vote system.

<h2>STAR-Vote</h2>


<p>
    The project was started in 2007 by Dan Wallach PhD of Rice University as VoteBox, a tamper-evident, verifiable electronic voting system.
    However, in the coming years the project evolved and today holds an entirely
    different form than the original VoteBox Project, hence the new name - STAR-Vote.
