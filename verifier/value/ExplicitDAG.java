/**
 * Data structure for modelling a DAG of time explicitly as a graph.
 *
 * Distributed logging messages make up a non-linear timeline. Because of the
 * possibility that two messages can be sent at the same time, or because the
 * possibility of a non-fully connected graph of nodes, not every message can be
 * claimed to exist either before or after every other message. This means that,
 * rather than the timeline being a "list" of messages, the timeline is a
 * "directed, acyclic graph" (or DAG) of messages. The job of this data
 * structure is to hold said DAG information.<br>
 * <br>
 * Information gathered during a DAG traversal is cached (memoized) for later
 * possible use.<br>
 * <br>
 * The dag storage format is not tied to a particular log format. Any
 * application specific log file which encodes precedence between log entries
 * can be expressed using one of these dags. The only constraint we place on the
 * format is that there be a canonical, unique "pointer" expression for every
 * expression in the log. This allows us to specify the DAG using two mappings:
 * (1) one which maps every pointer expression to the expression to which it
 * points, and (2) one which maps every expression to a list of pointer
 * expressions, each of which point to an expression provably succeeding the key
 * expression in the DAG. We simply check for equality between pointer
 * expressions in (2) and in (1) (essentially "connecting the dots") to
 * reconstruct the DAG.
